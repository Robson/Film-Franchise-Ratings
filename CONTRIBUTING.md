# Contributing Franchises

Film franchise recommendations are very welcome. Rules for inclusion:

## Requirements
 * Must have at least 3 films.
   * Some films don't count towards that, such as re-releases, direct-to-video films, etc.

## Notes

Some film franchises are part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, so it's worth checking to see if the franchise is already included within that.

Sometimes a franchise can be ambiguous. For example, the set of Harry Potter films and the Magical Beasts films could all be considered as one franchise or two franchises. There's no set rule for this, so it's just split/joined by whatever feels right.
